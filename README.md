# AirBnB Clone - The Console Project in Python

## Project Description:

This project is an AirBnB clone implemented in Python, featuring a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with and manage various aspects of the application. The primary focus of the project is to provide a simplified version of the AirBnB platform with basic functionalities for creating, managing, and searching for rental properties.

## Command Interpreter:

The command interpreter is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the AirBnB clone. It provides a set of commands to perform various operations, such as creating and managing users, places, and amenities. The goal is to offer a convenient and efficient way for users to navigate and manipulate the data within the application.

## How to Start the Command Interpreter:

To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youssefberrk/AirBnB_clone.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd AirBnB_clone
Run the command interpreter:
./console.py
Note: Ensure that the console.py file has executable permissions (chmod +x console.py).

##How to Use the Command Interpreter:
The command interpreter provides a set of commands for managing users, places, amenities, and more. Here are some basic commands:

#help: Display information about available commands.
#create: Create a new instance of a specified class.
#show: Display details of a specific instance.
#destroy: Delete a specified instance.
#all: Display all instances or instances of a specified class.
#update: Update the attributes of a specified instance.
For more detailed information on available commands and their usage, refer to the built-in help command:
(hbnb) help

## Examples:

#Create a new user:
(hbnb) create User

#Show details of a specific user:
(hbnb) show User <user_id>

#Display all places:
(hbnb) all Place

#Update the name attribute of a place:
(hbnb) update Place <place_id> name "New Place Name"

#Delete a user:
(hbnb) destroy User <user_id>
These examples illustrate some of the basic functionalities of the AirBnB clone command interpreter. Refer to the help command for a complete list of available commands and their usage.

Feel free to explore and interact with the command interpreter to manage your AirBnB clone application.
